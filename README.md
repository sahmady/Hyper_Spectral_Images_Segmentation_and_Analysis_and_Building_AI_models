# HySacs

Cereals are considered as one of most import sources of food throughout the world and some of the important cereals grown widely are rice, wheat, barley, maize, millets etc. and in this project we are interested to measure agronomical traits and more specifically the compositions traits of cereals based on hyperspectral images.

We have around 480 number of hyperspectral images from each VNIR and SWIR which are taken by two cameras each with 160 bands (400-1000 nm) and 256 bands (1000-2500 nm) respectively capturing each spike. And at the meanwhile we have the lab report for those spikes, more specifically based on grains of those spikes capturing their sugar contents of each compound class, oligosaccharide, monosaccharide and oligosaccharide e.g. nystose, glucose, fructose and maltose.

Motivation behind this project was to:

•	Implementation of hyperspectral image segmentation and analysis

•	Development of novel AI-based approaches

•	Oligosaccharides and other traits as important quality parameters

•	Enabling automated non-destructive measurements
